        <h1>About</h1>
          <p>I'm a recent graduate of the University of Pittsburgh’s Frederick Honors College, where I studied political science and criminal justice with minors in professional writing and information science. <br><br>I care deeply about building systems that are accessible and ready to meet the challenges of the digital age. Whether I’m creating materials for a criminal diversion program, developing frameworks for ethical data governance, or conducting policy research, my belief in the power of interdisciplinary problem-solving and informed design remains central to my work. </p>

             data-desc="<b>Government as a gateway: </b> Fresh off my first year at Pitt, I found myself captivated by the role of government in public health. Responsive, accessible government systems are responsible for delivering the essential services people depend upon. Interning in Congressman Paul Tonko’s Albany office, I fielded constituent inquiries and coordinated with federal agencies to address everything from passport delays to wetlands preservation. I remember one woman’s inquiry regarding backpaid benefits, her voice cracking with relief on the phone when I was able to deliver her the help she needed. I was also entrusted with reviewing the office’s full caseload and manning outreach events, a responsibility I didn’t expect to hold so early. This role underscored for me that our government is not some abstract entity, but real people helping other real people, and I wanted to be part of that.             ">

              data-desc="<b>Research as advocacy: </b> My growing interest in criminal justice led me to Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform (PfCJR), where I authored a white paper on minimizing solitary confinement. The work was difficult: reliable data was scarce, and policymakers seemed to treat incarcerated people’s health as an afterthought. I’ll never forget citing an obscure scientific study on the impact of social isolation on rat brain health as evidence to build my argument. I began to see research not just as an academic process, but as a form of advocacy for those whose experiences are overlooked or misunderstood. That shift changed how I approach information: as a bridge between injustice and accountability."

I’ll never forget the talent and ethical committment of the prosecutors with whom I worked. But I also came away with clarity: despite the intellectual thrill of the work, I didn’t feel called to criminal law. I loved legal work, but I needed to find a different space within it."

The role felt almost like historical fiction, using court records and even obituaries to reconstruct personal and legal histories. These moments taught me that legal systems are built not just on doctrine, but on the individuals who interpret and immortalize it. I began to see how storytelling could serve as a legal tool of its own."

I also compiled thousands of NGO reports for empirical analysis, often pulling from documents with only a few useful lines buried in dozens of pages. Some stories were heart-wrenching: families crossing multiple borders only to face hostility at each one. But being able to stitch these fragments into coherent, documented histories was important: I felt that I was creating a history for understudied and underserved peoples, highlighting their struggles in search of a safe, permanent home."

I was especially drawn to the office’s approach to constituent services as a form of organizing. I helped prepare office brochures and materials, was the first point of contact for constituent calls, and attended public meetings ahead of the Congresswoman’s run for re-election. This experience sharpened my understanding of what it takes to maintain an advocacy-forward office while navigating institutional constraints, and it pushed me to think critically about how government can balance values with operational delivery."

At Aon, I joined immersed myself in M&A, private equity, and renewable energy project risk. I remember spending hours parsing SEC filings and news stories, looking for information that could trigger a policy need. This experience helped me translate my policy acumen into the language of business strategy, and sparked a new appreciation for how private-sector tools can support public good when used responsibly.
